## This repo hosts the code for some Medium articles I've written. 

# cross-validation
The article can be found at https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-validation-a-beginners-guide-5b8ca04962cd

Each file performs validation on different sized datasets: smal, medium, and large as noted in the filenames.

# hyperparameters
The articel can be found at https://towardsdatascience.com/hyper-parameter-tuning-and-model-selection-like-a-movie-star-a884b8ee8d68

The files in the folder contain the code for the article as well as additional helper functions I've written. There is a notebook and .py version of the code available. Happy modelling!
